# Internet of Life Saving Thing (IoLST) for Firefighters


Goal: Development of an Internet of Things environmental sensing and communication system for fire rescue operations.


Sponsor: Zetron Inc. , University of Washington Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering

Team: Tianning Li, Hong Zhang, Shen Yuan Yao

Industry Mentor: Len Cayetano

Faculty Mentor: James K. Peckol 

## Project:

* UW ECE ENGineering INnovation and Entrepreneurship (ENGINE) SHOWCASE winning team.
* Create a prototype for the first responder (fireman) to help save lives for the firemen and the people inside the fire scene.
* Explored the concept of the Internet of Thing (IoT)/ the Internet of Life Saving Things (IoLST) which consists of Devices/ Sensors, Connectivity, Data Storage and Analysis.
* Experience using AWS system.

## Device:
* Microcontroller: Arduino.
* Sensors: collecting temperature and gas reading and picking sound signal (SOS).
* Connectivity: Use Hologram SIM card to send data through LTE-M.

## Cloud:
* Use AWS EC2 to receive streaming data.
* Deploy AWS web hosting with user security.
* Use mixed SQL and NoSQL data to store the information on the AWS EC2 and RDS.
* Apply simple data analysis and data processing on the data for displaying on the dashboard.
* Store past session data on the AWS RDS which can be easily replaced by other data storage system.
* Build a web dashboard to visualize data and information for the firemen using the D3.js library.
